V1.0 - 2023-06-14
=================
 *Changes:
Gauntlets of Ogre Power taken into account for melee accuracy strength bonus
Gauntlets no longer provide flat +2 melee accuracy bonus
Action range check for melee weapon attacks fixed in accuracy routine (off by one, affected bows)
Blanket -2 debuff to player melee accuracy rolls removed
Fixed thac0 table values (+3 plateau increase was only +2)
Fixed class-thac0 table mapping for dwarf and halfling
Gauntlets taken into account for melee damage strength bonus
Action range check for melee weapon attacks fixed in damage routine (off by one, affected bows)
Sword damage fixed (1-6 => 1-8)
Check for missile weapon in melee accuracy routine and use dex for bonus, not str
Check for missile weapon in melee damage routine and skip str bonus
Critical roll rules implemented (1 always misses, even if target is sleeping, 20 always hits)
Automatic hit no longer guaranteed on sleeping targets when using missile weapons
 *Notes:
Dwarf and halfling had cleric thac0 scaling, but the rules dictate fighter scaling so they were
upgraded. Thief originally had fighter scaling, and elf originally had cleric scaling. I have
refrained from amending these as an editorial choice to improve balance between the classes.
Sword damage was amended to reflect the rules, but none of the special swords (+2 vs Dragons etc.)
have been changed since I'm not even sure which of them, if any, are actually implemented and
available.
