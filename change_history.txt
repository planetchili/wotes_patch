V2.0 - 2024-06-28
=================
 *Changes:
Equal share of defeated monster XP among all living characters
XP bonus for class prime requisite
Quality of life improvements to make spellcasting much more user-friendly:
 - Selecting empty slot in combat automatically opens inventory
 - After choosing via auto-inventory automatically return to combat and use
Quality of life for resting (default to NO for change spell list so you can mash)
Fix thief hiding in dungeon:
 - Attacking in dungeon will clear the hidden status
 - It is now possible to hide while in the dungeon
Fix and rebalance blindness status (dark/light spells):
 - Saving throw for blindness spells => no longer a guaranteed hit
 - Blinded creatures can take their turns as usual => no longer fully incapacitated in tactical
 - Blinded creatures have debuffs to hit and dodge; easier to hit them, hard for them to hit you
 - Blinded enemies no longer wander around aimlessly in dungeon mode
 - Blindness debuff lengths shortened in tactical => no longer last for entire battle
 - Duration of blindness now has some dice variance, with a small bonus for caster INT (1d4+INT bonus)
Fixed broken melee calculation that caused huge debuff for enemies that hold weapons like swords etc.
 - Holding a sword was causing them to use the same code path as player characters
 - Player characters use STR bonus, but since enemy sheets have 0 STR, they would get a huge debuff!
Modified magic missile to get a small damage bonus from INT (+1, +2, or +3 for 18 INT)
Enabled C++ code to divide with operator / and to use the native CPU instruction when doing so

V1.0 - 2023-06-14
=================
 *Changes:
Gauntlets of Ogre Power taken into account for melee accuracy strength bonus
Gauntlets no longer provide flat +2 melee accuracy bonus
Action range check for melee weapon attacks fixed in accuracy routine (off by one, affected bows)
Blanket -2 debuff to player melee accuracy rolls removed
Fixed thac0 table values (+3 plateau increase was only +2)
Fixed class-thac0 table mapping for dwarf and halfling
Gauntlets taken into account for melee damage strength bonus
Action range check for melee weapon attacks fixed in damage routine (off by one, affected bows)
Sword damage fixed (1-6 => 1-8)
Check for missile weapon in melee accuracy routine and use dex for bonus, not str
Check for missile weapon in melee damage routine and skip str bonus
Critical roll rules implemented (1 always misses, even if target is sleeping, 20 always hits)
Automatic hit no longer guaranteed on sleeping targets when using missile weapons
 *Notes:
Dwarf and halfling had cleric thac0 scaling, but the rules dictate fighter scaling so they were
upgraded. Thief originally had fighter scaling, and elf originally had cleric scaling. I have
refrained from amending these as an editorial choice to improve balance between the classes.
Sword damage was amended to reflect the rules, but none of the special swords (+2 vs Dragons etc.)
have been changed since I'm not even sure which of them, if any, are actually implemented and
available.
